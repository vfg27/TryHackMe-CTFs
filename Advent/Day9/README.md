# TryHackMe Advent of Cyber - Day 9: Nine o'clock, make GRC fun, tell no one. 

McSkidy and Glitch need to hire an eDiscovery company to process forensic data for their investigation. They have received bids from three companies and must perform a risk assessment to identify the least risky option.

## Introduction to Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)

Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) ensures that security practices align with personal, regulatory, and legal obligations. Good security practices protect organisations from breaches, and external regulations may enforce minimum security standards based on the sector.

### Examples in the Financial Sector

- **Reserve Bank Regulations**: Security standards set by a country's reserve bank to protect customer funds and data.
- **SWIFT CSP**: Standards for secure communication in the SWIFT network after a major breach.
- **Data Protection**: Regulations to safeguard sensitive customer information.

### Role of GRC

GRC helps organisations:

1. Understand external security standards.
2. Translate them into internal policies.
3. Apply them across all teams to manage risks effectively.

#### Governance

- Creates a security framework aligned with organisational goals.
- Defines roles, responsibilities, and security strategies.

#### Risk

- Identifies and mitigates threats and vulnerabilities.
- Quantifies risk to reduce it to acceptable levels.

#### Compliance

- Ensures adherence to external regulations like GDPR, NIST, or ISO 27001.

## Risk Assessments

Risk assessments identify potential problems before they occur, enabling organisations to manage business risks effectively.

### Why Perform Risk Assessments?

Risk assessments help protect businesses by identifying weaknesses and addressing them proactively. For example, securing customer data in an online store prevents data breaches, safeguarding reputation and profits.

### Performing a Risk Assessment

A risk assessment involves:

1. **Identification of Risks**: Assess the attack surface to identify vulnerabilities like unpatched servers or high-privileged accounts.
2. **Assigning Likelihood**: Quantify the probability of risk occurrence on a scale (e.g., improbable to frequent).
3. **Assigning Impact**: Evaluate the potential impact of a risk (e.g., informational to critical).
4. **Risk Ownership**: Decide how to manage risks—whether to mitigate, accept, or document them.

### Internal vs. Third-Party Risk Assessments

- **Internal**: Identifies risks within the organisation to prioritise security measures and compliance.
- **Third-Party**: Evaluates risks posed by vendors, suppliers, or partners to protect the organisation from external vulnerabilities.

## McSkidy and Glitch's Plan

To select the safest eDiscovery company, McSkidy and Glitch will:

1. Create a risk assessment questionnaire for the companies.
2. Evaluate responses to identify the most secure and compliant option.
3. Reduce potential supply chain risks by selecting the least risky third party.

### Steps to Success

1. Ensure all third-party responses are thoroughly reviewed.
2. Align the chosen company’s security measures with internal standards.
3. Document the risk assessment process for future reference.

By conducting this risk assessment, McSkidy and Glitch can make an informed decision, ensuring their investigation proceeds securely and effectively.
