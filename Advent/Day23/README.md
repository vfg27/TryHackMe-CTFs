# TryHackMe Advent of Cyber - Day 23: You wanna know what happens to your hashes?

Glitch discovered a password-protected PDF file on a discarded tablet belonging to Mayor Malware. This CTF involves using password-cracking techniques to uncover the file's contents and uncover the evidence.

## **Learning Objectives**
By completing this challenge, you will learn about:
1. Hash functions and values.
2. Storing hashed passwords securely.
3. Cracking hashes using wordlists and rules.
4. Extracting and cracking passwords for encrypted documents.

---

## **Background**
### **Hash Functions**
- A hash function takes an input and returns a fixed-size value.
- Example: **SHA-256** creates a 256-bit hash value, regardless of input size.
- For secure password storage, passwords should be hashed with a **salt** to prevent common attacks like rainbow table lookups.

Example:
- Password: `password`
- Hashed (MD5): `ce1bccda287f1d9e6d80dbd4cb6beb60`
- With Salt: `hash(password + salt)`

### **Common Passwords**
Many users pick simple, memorable passwords. For example, the most common passwords include:
1. `123456`
2. `password`
3. `qwerty`

Mayor Malware might create passwords based on his cat, Fluffy, or his title (e.g., `m4y0r2024`).

## **Challenge Breakdown**

### **Step 1: Analyze the Password Hash**
1. **Locate the Hash**:
   - Path: `/home/user/AOC2024/hash1.txt`
   - Content: `d956a72c83a895cb767bb5be8dba791395021dcece002b689cf3b5bf5aaa20ac`
2. **Identify the Hash Type**:
   ```bash
   cd AOC2024/
   cat hash1.txt
   python hash-id.py
   ```
   Output suggests the hash type is **SHA-256**.

### **Step 2: Crack the Password Hash**
#### **Attempt 1: RockYou Wordlist**
Use `John the Ripper` with the `rockyou.txt` wordlist:
```bash
john --format=raw-sha256 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash1.txt
```
If unsuccessful, apply rules to test transformations:
```bash
john --format=raw-sha256 --rules=wordlist --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash1.txt
```

#### **Attempt 2: Custom Wordlist**
1. Create a custom wordlist (`wordlist.txt`) with:
   - Fluffy
   - FluffyCat
   - Mayor
   - Malware
   - MayorMalware
2. Use the custom wordlist with more extensive rules:
```bash
john --rules=single --wordlist=wordlist.txt hash1.txt
```
3. Recover the password and verify using:
```bash
john --format=raw-sha256 --show hash1.txt
```

---

### **Step 3: Crack the PDF File**
1. **Generate a PDF Hash**:
   Convert the password-protected PDF into a crackable hash using `pdf2john.pl`:
   ```bash
   pdf2john.pl private.pdf > pdf.hash
   cat pdf.hash
   ```

2. **Crack the PDF Hash**:
   Use `John the Ripper` with the custom wordlist:
   ```bash
   john --rules=single --wordlist=wordlist.txt pdf.hash
   ```
3. Once cracked, open the PDF with the recovered password to uncover the evidence.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
1. **Hash Storage Best Practices**:
   - Use modern algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
   - Incorporate salts to improve security.
2. **Password Cracking**:
   - Wordlists like `rockyou.txt` are valuable but not always sufficient.
   - Custom wordlists based on target profiling increase success rates.
3. **Document Security**:
   - Secure sensitive files with strong, unique passwords.
   - Avoid predictable patterns when setting passwords.

---

## **Conclusion**
By cracking the hash and opening the PDF, Glitch has uncovered Mayor Malwareâ€™s secrets, advancing the investigation. This challenge underscores the importance of understanding hashing, secure password storage, and cracking techniques for offensive and defensive security roles.
